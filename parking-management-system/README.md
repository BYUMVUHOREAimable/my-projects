## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Hardware Setup**
   - Connect RFID reader to Arduino
   - Connect webcam to PC
   - Power up the system

2. **Software Setup**
   ```bash
   # Install Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Upload Arduino code
   # Open Arduino IDE and upload process_payment.ino and top_up.ino
   ```

3. **System Initialization**
   - Run the main system:
   ```bash
   python hardware/main.py
   ```

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Vehicle Entry**
   - License plate is captured and recognized
   - RFID card is initialized with plate number and balance
   - Entry time is recorded

2. **Vehicle Exit**
   - License plate is verified
   - RFID card is read
   - Parking fee is calculated
   - Balance is updated
   - Exit is processed
